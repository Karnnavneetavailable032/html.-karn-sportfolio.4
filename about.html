👨‍💻 About Me</h1>
Hi, I’m Karn Navneet, a 19-year-old B.Tech student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I’m currently in my 2nd year and living in a PG accommodation, balancing my academic grind with a disciplined fitness routine and a passion for creating impactful content.

<h3>🎯 What Drives Me</h3>
I believe in consistency over motivation — whether it's writing clean code, staying fit, or pushing a new idea live. I’ve always been someone who values structure, self-discipline, and continuous improvement. My days usually begin with morning runs and bodyweight exercises and end with focused gym sessions — a balance that keeps both my mind and body sharp.

📚 Course Focus: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Engineering Principles<br/>

👨‍🔬 Academic Project Work: Developing structured C programs for lab practicals (e.g., BES07010 - Data Structures Lab)<br/>

💡 Coding Style: Clean, documented, and optimized for understanding<br/>

Fitness is more than a habit—it's my daily reset button. I often share motivational reels and content to inspire others on their own journey too.<br/>
